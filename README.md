# Blog Platform with Authentication and RBAC

This is a Node.js-based blog platform that implements secure Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The application is designed for managing users and their permissions to create, edit, and view blog posts based on roles such as Admin, Editor, Author, and Reader.

---

## Features

### Authentication
- Secure user registration with hashed passwords using bcrypt.
- Login functionality with password validation.
- JWT-based authentication for secure session management.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Four distinct roles: Admin, Editor, Author, and Reader.
- Role-based middleware to protect routes and restrict actions.
- Granular permissions for post management based on roles.

### Authorization
- Middleware to check user permissions and validate roles.
- Post ownership verification for secure updates and edits.
- Route protection for sensitive operations.

### Blog Post Management
- Create blog posts with a title, content, and status (draft, published, or archived).
- Update blog posts with ownership or elevated role privileges.
- Store posts securely in a MongoDB database linked to user profiles.

### Security Best Practices
- Password hashing for secure user credentials.
- Input validation to prevent malicious requests.
- Comprehensive error handling for debugging and user feedback.

---

## Technology Stack
- Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js.
- Database: MongoDB for scalable and secure data storage.
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user sessions.
- Middleware: Custom middleware for authentication and role-based authorization.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB server running locally or accessible remotely.

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/blog-rbac
```

### 4. Run the Application
Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will run at `http://localhost:3000`.
